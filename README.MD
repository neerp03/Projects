Java and JavaScript Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of Java-based projects along with one JavaScript project, highlighting core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and essential data structures. These projects collectively demonstrate proficiency in:

OOP Principles: Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Inheritance

Data Structures: Binary Trees, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues

Robust Exception Handling and error management

Clean, Modular, and Maintainable Code

The Java projects illustrate various use cases, ranging from algorithm implementation to backend, emphasizing best practices in software engineering. Additionally, the JavaScript project showcases interactive front-end logic, integrating collision detection and responsive user interfaces.

This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio, demonstrating both theoretical understanding and practical application of key programming concepts.
